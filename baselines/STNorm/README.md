The STNorm in BasicTS follows its original implementation; however, this hyperparameter design may lead to some misunderstandings.

    def __init__(self, num_nodes, tnorm_bool, snorm_bool, in_dim, out_dim, channels, kernel_size, blocks, layers):
```

 Hereâ€™s a further clarification: 
 - `in_dim` and `out_dim` are not the same concept.
 - `in_dim` refers to the number of input channels, specifically the `C` in `[B, L, N, C]`. 
 - Meanwhile, `out_dim` actually represents the output length, which corresponds to the `L` in `[B, L, N, C]`.
 - Additionally, STNorm does not implicitly specify the input length. 
- Instead, it controls the receptive field (i.e., the effective input length) by adjusting the number of convolutional layers and the size of the convolutional kernels.
