This directory currently supports inference only. Training MOIRAI involves a combination of multiple libraries, including GluonTS and PyTorch Lightning, making it difficult to directly port into BasicTS.

If you are interested in training MOIRAI using the BLAST dataset, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/zezhishao/MOIRAI-BLAST).
