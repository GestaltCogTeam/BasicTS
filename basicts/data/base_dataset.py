class BaseDataset(Dataset):
    """
    An abstract base class for creating datasets for time series forecasting in PyTorch.

    This class provides a structured template for defining custom datasets by specifying methods
    to load data and descriptions, and to access individual samples. It is designed to be subclassed
    with specific implementations for different types of time series data.

    Attributes:
        dataset_name (str): The name of the dataset which is used for identifying the dataset uniquely.
        train_val_test_ratio (List[float]): Ratios for splitting the dataset into training, validation,
            and testing sets respectively. Each value in the list should sum to 1.0.
        mode (str): Operational mode of the dataset. Valid values are "train", "valid", or "test".
        input_len (int): The length of the input sequence, i.e., the number of historical data points used.
        output_len (int): The length of the output sequence, i.e., the number of future data points predicted.
        overlap (bool): Flag to indicate whether the splits between training, validation, and testing can overlap.
            Defaults to True but can be set to False to enforce non-overlapping data in different sets.
