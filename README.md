## 0. What is BasicTS

BasicTS (**Basic** **T**ime **S**eries) is an open-source PyTorch-based time series benchmark and toolbox motivated by [BasicSR](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR) [1].
At present, it only focuses on time series forecasting, and may add time series classification, anomaly detection, etc., in the future.
BasicTS provides users with a ***unified, standard pipeline***  (fair, but probably not the fastest), which provides ***reproduction and fair comparision*** of popular deep learning-based time series models to inspire new innovations.
BasicTS is developed based on [EasyTorch](https://github.com/cnstark/easytorch) [2], an easy-to-use and powerful open source neural network training framework.

BasicTS (**Basic** **T**ime **S**eries)是一个受[BasicSR](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR) [1]启发的基于PyTorch的开源时间序列Benchmark和工具箱。
目前仅专注于时间序列预测，后续可能会添加时间序列分类、异常检测等内容。
BasicTS为用户提供 ***统一的、标准的*** pipeline（他是公平的，但可能不是最快的），来提供流行的基于深度学习的时间序列模型的 ***复现和公平对比*** ，以启发新的创新。
BasicTS基于一个易用、强大的开源神经网络训练框架[EasyTorch](https://github.com/cnstark/easytorch) [2]开发。

If this repository helps your research or work, I hope you could give me a ⭐, and I will keep updating it. If you need more features about BasicTS (e.g. more datasets or methods) or have any questions/suggestions, please feel free to let me know~

Although we have tried our best to tune the hyperparameters in `basicts/options` for every model and every dataset, there is no guarantee that they are optimal.
Thus, any PRs for better hyper-parameters are welcomed to make BasicTS fairer.

### 1.2 Long-term Time Series Forecasting

🕐

## 2. Installing Dependencies

### 2.1 Main Dependencies

- python 3.9
- pytorch 1.9.1
- easy-torch latest

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Please use `pip install easy-torch`, instead of `pip install easytorch`, to install [EasyTorch](https://github.com/cnstark/easytorch). They are different two packages. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

### 2.2 Installing from Pip

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 3. Codebase Designs and Conventions

🕐

## 4. Usage

`git clone https://github.com/zezhishao/BasicTS.git`

### 4.1 Data Preparation and Preprocessing

#### 4.1.1 Data Preparation

You can download the raw datasets at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14EJVODCU48fGK0FkyeVom_9lETh80Yjp) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18qonT9l1_NbvyAgpD4381g)(password: 0lrk), and unzip them to `datasets/raw_data/`.

#### 4.1.2 Data Preprocessing

```bash
cd /path/to/project
python scripts/data_preparation/$DATASET_NAME/generate_training_data.py
```

Replace `$DATASET_NAME` with one of `METR-LA`, `PEMS-BAY`, `PEMS03`, `PEMS04`, `PEMS07`, `PEMS08`, or any other supported dataset.

The processed data will be placed in `datasets/$DATASET_NAME`.

Details of preprocessing can be found in `docs/DataPreparation_CN.md`~(Chinese).

### 4.2 Run a Time Series Forecasting Model

We recommend running a time series model with the following command:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
easytrain -c basicts/options/$METHOD_NAME/$METHOD_NAME_$DATASET_NAME.py --gpus '0'
```

Replace the `$METHOD_NAME` and `$DATASET_NAME` with any supported method and dataset. For example,

```bash
easytrain -c basicts/options/GraphWaveNet/GraphWaveNet_METR-LA.py --gpus '0'
```

If you need to debug, you could run the `basicts/run.py` file. 

### 4.3 Train a Custom Model

## 5. Detailed Docs

## 6. Main Results

![Main results.](results/result.png)

## 7. TODO

- [ ] : add the result of STID.
- [ ] : revise the data preprocessing of PEMS07, which only contains weekdays.
- [ ] : Add detailed documentation and a demo about data preprocessing.
- [ ] : Add more multivariate time series datasets: Traffic, Electricity, Exchange-Rate, ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, Weather, Solar-Energy.
- [ ] : Different from the existing traffic datasets (PEMS0X, PEMS-BAY, METR-LA), these datasets have multiple usages in the existing datasets, and the baselines that need to be compared in different contexts are different. Therefore, it is necessary to add statistics for all datasets and describe their typical settings case by case.
- [ ] : Add statistical information of these dataset, and descibe their typical settings.
- [ ] : Support models like ASTGCN, ASTGNN, which take multi-periodicities data as input.
- [ ] : Add detailed docs about 4.2, e.g., the usage of gpu.
- [ ] : Update D2STGNN arch.
- [ ] : 模块化train_iters, val_iters, and test_iters中的过程。否则就会像GTS一样, 一旦模型有一点特殊 (例如多一个返回和不同的loss), 就必须重写整个train_iters, val_iters, and test_iters。
