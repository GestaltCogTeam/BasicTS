    """
    ZScoreScaler performs Z-score normalization on the dataset, transforming the data to have a mean of zero 
    and a standard deviation of one. This is commonly used in preprocessing to normalize data, ensuring that 
    each feature contributes equally to the model.

    Attributes:
        mean (np.ndarray): The mean of the training data used for normalization. 
            If `norm_each_channel` is True, this is an array of means, one for each channel. Otherwise, it's a single scalar.
        std (np.ndarray): The standard deviation of the training data used for normalization.
            If `norm_each_channel` is True, this is an array of standard deviations, one for each channel. Otherwise, it's a single scalar.
        target_channel (int): The specific channel (feature) to which normalization is applied.
            By default, it is set to 0, indicating the first channel.

        Initialize the ZScoreScaler by loading the dataset and fitting the scaler to the training data.

        The scaler computes the mean and standard deviation from the training data, which is then used to 
        normalize the data during the `transform` operation.

        Args:
            norm_each_channel (bool): Flag indicating whether to normalize each channel separately. 
                If True, the mean and standard deviation are computed for each channel independently.
            rescale (bool): Flag indicating whether to apply rescaling after normalization. This flag is included for consistency with 
                the base class but is not directly used in Z-score normalization.
